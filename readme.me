## Azure Storage
This application will use the Storage Account associated with the Function App to setup a table.  That table will need to be initialized with the `createTablestr.ps1` file in this repo.  You may Advanced
additional tableNames to the Azure Storage Table to read from.  Leaving the `LastRead` value blank will ensure the script pulls data from the last 30 day on the initial run.

  1. Stand up a blank PowerShell Function App with Timer Trigger.  
  2. Replace Run.ps1 with file contained here.
  3. Configure the following ENV Variables in **Application Setting**:
    - `appSecret`
    - `azstoragestring`
    - `clientID`
    - `SharedKey`
    - `tenantId`
